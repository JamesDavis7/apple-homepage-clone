# Apple Homepage Clone

A clone of the 2021 Apple Homepage (UK Version, early May). The site
combines flexbox and the grid system to keep all elements neat and
equally spaced. The main sources of JavaScript include the responsive
navbar menu and the mobile footer dropdown menus

Every screen break triggers a different image for all the cards,
based upon the users viewport size.
